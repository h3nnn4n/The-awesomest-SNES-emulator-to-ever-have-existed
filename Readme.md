The main purpose of this branch is prototyping simple things outside of master and it will serve both as a playground and as a archive.

Rust was installed on (arch) linux using:
```
curl -f https://sh.rustup.rs > rust.sh
chmod +x rust.sh
./rust.sh
```

The follow options were used:
```
   default host triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     default toolchain: stable
  modify PATH variable: yes
```

`export PATH=/home/h3nnn4n/.cargo/bin:$PATH` was added to `.{bash,zsh}rc` and `rustup default stable` was ran.
